Explanation for Presentation
With SoC: The first version showcases proper Separation of Concerns. The HTML is clean, with minimal classes that describe what the content is rather than how it should look. The CSS is separated, making the codebase easier to maintain and allowing for reuse across multiple components.

Without SoC: The second version lacks SoC. The HTML contains specific classes that mix content with presentation logic, making it harder to maintain and scale. Changes in the design will require modifying both HTML and CSS, increasing the potential for errors and inconsistencies.

Next Steps
You can demonstrate both versions during your presentation, emphasizing the benefits of SoC in terms of maintainability, reusability, and scalability.
Use the differences between the two pages to discuss how proper SoC can lead to cleaner, more efficient code, while a lack of SoC can result in a disorganized and hard-to-manage codebase.
Would you like to implement these pages or need help with something else for your presentation?

4. Explanation for Presentation
During your presentation, you can show the two versions side by side:

With SoC (First Page): The separation between HTML, CSS, and components makes the code easier to maintain and extend. It’s clear which styles belong to which elements, and classes are reusable across different components.

Without SoC (Second Page): All styles are embedded directly in the HTML, making the code harder to maintain. If you want to reuse the styles or make changes, you would need to touch multiple parts of your code.

5. Running the Pages
You can view these pages by opening the respective index.html files in your browser.

1. Customizing the Design:
Theme Colors: We can choose a specific color scheme to make the pages visually appealing and consistent with your presentation.
Typography: Use web fonts or custom fonts to improve the text's visual appeal.
Icons: Replace the placeholder icons with real ones using libraries like Font Awesome.
2. Interactive Elements:
Hover Effects: Add hover effects to buttons or links to demonstrate interactive design.
Responsive Design: Make the pages responsive to showcase best practices in frontend development.
Animations: Include simple animations for better visual engagement.
3. Adding JavaScript:
Interactive Features: Implement JavaScript for additional functionality like tooltips, modals, or toggling content visibility.
Form Validation: If your page includes forms, add JavaScript-based validation to show how JS integrates with SoC.
4. Commented Code:
Detailed Comments: Add comments in the code to explain key sections, making it easier for your audience to understand.
5. Live Demo Setup:
CodePen or GitHub Pages: Host the pages online so you can provide a live demo during your presentation.
Version Control: Showcase the development process using Git to emphasize collaboration and tracking changes.
6. Comparison Slides:
Before & After: Create slides that show side-by-side comparisons of the HTML/CSS with and without SoC.
Performance Impact: Discuss how SoC affects page load times, maintainability, and scalability.
7. Practical Examples:
Real-world Applications: Provide examples of popular frameworks or libraries that follow SoC principles (e.g., React, Angular).
Case Study: Share a brief case study where SoC improved a project’s outcome.
